## New Website!

Previous website had so much overhead and was a MESS. I've switched to using this statically generated site, using Jekyll.

I've always been pretty bad at keeping organized notes, and as a result, never look back at them. I think markdown is a great way to jot down and format math and physics notes, so I hope to make this website a quick and easy way to write them up and access them. 

## Motivations 

+ Theme 
  - [Paper on Readability](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jbigham/pubs/pdfs/2017/colors.pdf)
+ Jupyter Notebooks on static website
  - [Embed Interactive Jupyter Notebook](https://elc.github.io/posts/embed-interactive-notebooks/)
