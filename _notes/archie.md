## Archie the T480
When it comes to Linux, hardware is not that important, I'm pretty sure Linus still codes the Linux Kernel on 2Gb RAM netbooks. However, I believe an overwhelming majority of Linux-ers use a Thinkpad as their primary driver. Maybe it's because both Linux and Thinkpads (at least before they joined the "thin-n-lights") share a lot of themes such as modularity, usability, and reliability. The point is, instead of opting for a Zoomer laptop, I've managed to snagged a Thinkpad T480 for a good deal. For the same reasons mentioned above, I think I'm obligated to install a "hackerman" DIY distro, in this case [ArchLinux](https://archlinux.org/) (also because Linux is [well supported by Lenovo ](https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/pd031426-linux-for-personal-systems) and by the [Arch community](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Lenovo_ThinkPad_T480)).
