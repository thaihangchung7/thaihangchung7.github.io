# Pre-Requisites

The data analysis software (VEPFIT) can only run on Windows 98 for now. Rather than installing the ancient OS on your drive, we get around this through [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/).

# Readable File Formats

- Set VirtualBox Network setting to "Bridged Adapter"

# Transferring Data Between VM and Host
