<h2 id="introduction-to-dune">Introduction to DUNE</h2>

<p>The Deep Underground Neutrino observatory (DUNE) comes packaged with a couple of facilities. The main ones being: FermiLab (FNAL), the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF), and the Long Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNL).</p>

<p>The experiment begins at PIP-II, Fermilabâ€™s linear accelerator. A mega-watt (up to 1.2 MW) class proton beam is produced, moving the protons through a series of boosters at 8 GeV where they reach the main injector at 120 GeV, eventually accelerated close to c.</p>

<p>The main injector ring smashes the protons into a fixed 1.5m target, producing Pions and Kaons. Focusing horns along the injector can be switched to focus Pions and Kaons of the opposite charge to produce a beam of antineutrinos.</p>

<p>Thereby producing a high intensity beam of neutrinos and anti neutrinos of the muon flavor</p>

<h2 id="physics-of-dune-far-detector-at-least">Physics of DUNE (Far Detector at least)</h2>
<p>Neutrino Oscillations were first discovered</p>

<p>charged current refers to an interaction where a charged weak force carrier \((W^+ \) or \(W^-)\) are exchanged</p>
