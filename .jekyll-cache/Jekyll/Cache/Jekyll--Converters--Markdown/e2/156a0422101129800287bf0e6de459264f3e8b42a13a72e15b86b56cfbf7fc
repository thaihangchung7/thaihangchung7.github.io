I"¢	<p>Some of the notes and talking points for my presentation on DUNE.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-to-dune">Introduction to DUNE</h2>

<p>The Deep Underground Neutrino observatory (DUNE) comes packaged with a couple of facilities. The main ones being: FermiLab (FNAL), the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF), and the Long Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNL).</p>

<p>The experiment begins at PIP-II, Fermilab‚Äôs linear accelerator. A mega-watt (up to 1.2 MW) class proton beam is produced, moving the protons through a series of boosters at 8 GeV where they reach the main injector at 120 GeV, eventually accelerated close to c.</p>

<p>The main injector ring smashes the protons into a fixed 1.5m target, producing Pions and Kaons. Focusing horns along the injector can be switched to focus Pions and Kaons of the opposite charge to produce a beam of antineutrinos.</p>

<p>Thereby producing a high intensity beam of neutrinos and anti neutrinos of the muon flavor</p>

<h2 id="physics-of-dune-far-detector-at-least">Physics of DUNE (Far Detector at least)</h2>
<p>Experimental measurements were made by the Super Kamiokande Observatory (Super-K) in 1998 and the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) in 2001. The 2015 Nobel Prize for ‚Äúthe discovery of neutrino oscillations, which shows that neutrinos have mass‚Äù was awarded to Takaaki Kajita and Arthur B. McDonald. The theoretical prediction was provided by Bruno Pontecorvo way back in 1957.</p>

<p>Recall that neutrinos only interact via the standard model charged current and neutral current weak interactions. Charged current refers to an interaction where a charged weak force carrier \((W^+ \) or \(W^-)\) are exchanged. Whereas neutral current refers to interactions with a neutrally charged weak force carrier $(Z^0)$.</p>

<p>We look at the matrix that describes the mixing between mass and weak eigenstates of the neutrino, the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) Matrix:
\(\begin{pmatrix}
\nu_{e}\\ 
\nu_{\mu}\\ 
\nu_{\tau}
\end{pmatrix}=
\begin{pmatrix}
U_{e1} &amp; U_{e2} &amp; U_{e3}\\ 
U_{e1} &amp; U_{e2} &amp; U_{e3}\\ 
U_{e1} &amp; U_{e2} &amp; U_{e3}
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}
\nu_{1}\\ 
\nu_{2}\\ 
\nu_{3}
\end{pmatrix}\)</p>

<p>The probability of Oscillation is given by:
\(P_{Oscillation} (\nu_{\mu} \rightarrow \nu_{e}) = \left |  \left \langle \nu_{e} | \nu_{\mu} (t) \right \rangle\right |^{2} = \sin^{2} 2\theta_{12} \sin^{2} ( 1.27 \Delta m^{2}_{21} \frac{L}{E})\)</p>
