Adding some more information regarding the DUNE data aquisition systems.

## The DUNE WIB and Friends 
The heart of of the DUNE data aquisition infastructure is the Warm Interface Board (WIB), which is responsible for controlling and configuring the front end electronics (namely the FEMB, more on that in a bit) and transfers massive amounts of data (over 40Gb/s!) via optical links to the data aquisition system. Eventually, the WIBs will be installed in a Warm Interface Electronics Crate (WIEC), each crate containing four WIBs. 

Designed around a Xilinx Zynq Ultrascale+ FPGA, this allows for programmable logic gates and processing systems at a lower level than a CPU which allows for rapid prototyping.


Connected to the WIB are front end electronics, otherwise known as Front End MotherBoards (FEMB), that are dunked in Liquid Argon (LAr). Whenever an ionized electron from an interaction is produced the signal is passed through LAr Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) low noise amplifiers eventually making its way though another set of Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) ASICs.
