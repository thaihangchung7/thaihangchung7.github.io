Some of the notes and talking points for my presentation on DUNE.

## Introduction to DUNE

The Deep Underground Neutrino observatory (DUNE) comes packaged with a couple of facilities. The main ones being: FermiLab (FNAL), the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF), and the Long Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNL). 

The experiment begins at PIP-II, Fermilab's linear accelerator. A mega-watt (up to 1.2 MW) class proton beam is produced, moving the protons through a series of boosters at 8 GeV where they reach the main injector at 120 GeV, eventually accelerated close to c. 

The main injector ring smashes the protons into a fixed 1.5m target, producing Pions and Kaons. Focusing horns along the injector can be switched to focus Pions and Kaons of the opposite charge to produce a beam of antineutrinos. 

Thereby producing a high intensity beam of neutrinos and anti neutrinos of the muon flavor

## Physics of DUNE (Far Detector at least)
Neutrino Oscillations were first discovered 

charged current refers to an interaction where a charged weak force carrier \\((W^+ \\) or \\(W^-)\\) are exchanged
