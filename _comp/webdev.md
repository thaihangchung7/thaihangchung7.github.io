## New Website!

Previous website had so much bloat and was a MESS. I've switched to using this statically generated site, using Jekyll.

I've always been pretty bad at keeping organized notes, and as a result, never look back at them. Online notes have many advantages:

- Word searchable (and equation searchable to an extent)<sup>if I was actually consistent with equation formatting...</sup>
- git controlled
- Easily accessible
- Live LaTeX support with an html snippet
