# Geant4 Kernel Structure

## Geant4 Classes:

### Events
**Class**: G4Events

At the beginning of prcoessing, the event contains primary particles which are pushed into a stack. The G4Event has the following objects at the end of its processing or when the stack becomes empty: 

+ List of primary vertexes and particles
+ Trajectory collection (optional)
+ Hits Collection
+ Digits Collection (optional)

### G4 Tracks
*Tracks are made of three layers of class objects*

**G4Track**
+ Position, Volume, Track Length, global ToF
+ ID of itself and mother track

**G4DynamicParticle**
+ Momentum, Energy, local time, polarization
+ Pre-fix decay channel

**G4ParticleDefinition**
+ Shared by all G4DynamicParticle of same type
+ Mass, lifetime, charge, other physical quantities
+ Decay Table


Tracks are deleted when: 
+ it goes out of the world volume
+ it disappears (a decay)
+ it goes down to zero kinetic energy and no "at rest" additional process is required
+ the user decides to kill it

## Step
Step has two points and is limitted by the volume boundary. The end point physically stands on the boundary, and it logically belongs to the next volume.

+ contains delta
